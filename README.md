# react-starting-toolkit
Just a simple toolkit the get a react project up and running with gulp automated tasks.


Wanna use it:
- Download it as a starting point for your project
- Write down "npm install" to get a whole lot of dependencies installed (it's not that bad!)
- Run the "gulp" command using terminal/console and see the magic happens.
